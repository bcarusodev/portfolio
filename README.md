# Personal Portfolio NextJS app

Using [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as component library within a NextJS app with TypeScript.

### Idea

Portfolio project used to display some of my services, projects, and some things about me.

### Commands to run

`npm install` (first time)

`npm run dev`

### Some things used

- Atomic Design pattern
- Prettier, husky pre-commit
- Framer Motion transitions
- ContentLayer
