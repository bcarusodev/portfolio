# Personal Portfolio NextJS app

Using [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as component library within a NextJS app with TypeScript.

### Idea

This showcase app will be used to display some of my services, projects, and
some things about me, also im learning new things and techniques
in the entire process of development.

### Commands to run

`npm install` (first time)

`npm run dev`

### Some things used

- Atomic Design pattern
- Prettier, husky pre-commit

---

Used NextJS+TS boilerplate from https://github.com/nishuzumi/with-chakra-ui-typescript
